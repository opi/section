SECTION
-------

Section is a drupal module for CCK, which lets you add a section field to your content type. 
A section could have multiple value, and that's where this field is  usefull.
A section has a Name & a value. For now, the section name is a textfield, and the section value could be a textfield or a textarea.

Think of definition list, questions/answers, name & first name list...

I made the module to avoid using cck3 dev branch with multigroup.
